## In the simplified version of the chat application provided, several design patterns and architectural principles were applied to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Here's an overview of these patterns and how they were used:

1. **Repository Pattern**

   - The Repository pattern was employed through the repository package, which abstracts the data layer. It provides a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects (such as users and messages), allowing for decoupling the application's core logic from the details of data access. This pattern is evident in the user_repository.go and message_repository.go files, where interfaces define the operations that can be performed on the data models without specifying how these operations are executed.

2. **Service Layer Pattern**

   - The services package implements the Service Layer pattern, which defines a set of service interfaces to execute business logic operations or transactions involving multiple data models. For instance, the jwt_service.go file contains logic for generating and validating JWT tokens, abstracting the complexities of token management from the rest of the application.

3. **Dependency Injection**

   - Dependency Injection (DI) is used throughout the application to manage dependencies between objects. This is not a pattern that was explicitly demonstrated in the code snippets due to the brevity of examples, but the idea is to instantiate your services (e.g., JWTService, UserService) at the application's entry point (main.go) or using a DI framework and then pass these instances to where they are needed. This approach simplifies testing and decouples the application components.

4. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) - Adapted**

- While not a pure implementation, the project structure hints at an adapted version of the MVC pattern, especially in how it organizes the handling of HTTP requests and responses:

- Models: Defined in the models package, representing the application's data structures.
- Controllers (Handlers): Present in the handlers package, they respond to HTTP requests, interacting with models and services to perform operations.
  Views: Not explicitly defined, as the application likely serves JSON responses directly, but the responses themselves can be considered as part of the "view" in a broad sense.

5. **Middleware Pattern**

   - The Middleware pattern is used within the Gin framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. It's particularly evident in the middlewares package, where authentication middleware is defined. This middleware checks for valid JWT tokens in the request headers, ensuring that certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

6. **Factory Pattern**

   - The Factory pattern is subtly suggested in the structure, where functions like NewUserService or NewJWTService act as factories that encapsulate the creation of service objects, potentially hiding the complexity of object creation and allowing for future extensions, such as adding initialization parameters or configuring dependencies dynamically.

7. **Singleton Pattern**

   - While not explicitly demonstrated due to the snippet's nature, the database connection setup (database/db.go) typically follows the Singleton pattern in many applications. A single database connection pool is created and reused throughout the application's lifecycle, ensuring efficiency and preventing redundant connections.

## These patterns and principles help structure the application in a way that separates concerns, promotes code reuse, and facilitates testing.
